This is a utility to change a serial number of a FT245R chip.

This tool requires libftdi and is known to work with libftdi-1.0

In order to change the serial number string, it only replaces the user area,
where manufacturer name, product name and serial number are stored.
The first two are written unchanged, and the serial number is replaced with the
value passed as command-line argument.

To build the ftdi245r_serial binary:

 make

Then run the tool like this:

 ./ftdi245r_serial m0000023

where m0000023 is the serial number to write to EEPROM.

The above command will read the configuration from the device, extract the old
EEPROM value and write updated configuration with new serial number into
a file named ftdi245r.eeprom.

You can compare the generated file with the stock configuration included
in a file named monome_mk_orig_ftdi245r.eeprom. The latter contains a default
value of serial number starting with "mk" which makes libmonome use the
series protocol for communicating with the monome device.
If you have flashed a newer firmware that uses the mext protocol, you will
want to use a serial number like m0000023 which will make libmonome select
the mext protocol.

In order to compare the two files, run a command:

 make cmp

If you are satisfied with the result, you can write the generated
eeprom to the ftdi chip with this command:

 make flash

If you find this tool useful, feel free to donate me some bucks.
