Change serial of a FT245R chip.

This tool requires libftdi and is known to work with libftdi-1.0

It changes the only the user-area values only - manufacturer, product
and serial strings. The first two are being preserved. The three string
are written in the above order.

To build the ftdi245r_serial binary:

 make

Then run the tool like this:

 ./ftdi245r_serial m0000023

The above command will create a file named ftdi245r.eeprom
You can compare ftdi245r.eeprom with an eeprom in the file
named monome_mk_orig_ftdi245r.eeprom.
monome_mk_orig_ftdi245r.eeprom is known to work but
has stock serial that is incomatible with libmonome.
Compare the two files like this:

 make cmp

If you are satisfied with the result, you can write the generated
eeprom to the ftdi chip with this command:

 make flash

If you find this tool useful, feel free to donate me some bucks.
